# Association Rule Discovery Defined :
The rules are expressed as ‚Äúif item A is part of a transaction, then item B is also part of the transaction X percent of the time.‚Äù where 0 < X ‚â§ 100.

# Support: 
Support is the percentage of transactions that contain an itemset X: Pr(ùëã)=100%√óùëÅx/ùëÅ where ùëÅx is number of transactions that contain an itemset, N is the total number of transactions, support indicates the rate of occurance (relative frequency) of an itemset

# Confidence: 
Confidence is the percentage of transactions that will contain itemset Y if itemset X is already present: Pr(ùëå|ùëã)=Pr(ùëã and ùëå)‚àïPr(ùëã), Pr(ùëå|ùëã) = (Support of X and Y) / (Support of X), Pr(ùëå|ùëã) = (Number of transactions that contain both itemset X and itemset Y) / (Number of transactions that contain itemset X), Confidence metric is the condition probability that itemset Y will be in the transaction given itemset X is already in the transaction, Confidence metric indicates how credible about the association rule: X ‚Üí Y (If itemset X is in the transaction, then itemset Y will also in the transaction)

# Expected Confidence: 
Expected Confidence is, essentially, the support of itemset Y: Pr(ùëå), If occurrence of itemset X will not affect the occurrence of itemset Y, then the percentage of transactions that will contain itemset Y if itemset X is already present is basically the percentage of transactions that will contain itemset Y. Expected confidence is the confidence of the association rule X ‚Üí Y under the independence assumption. 

# Lift: 
Lift is the ratio of the Confidence to Expected Confidence. Mathematically, lift value is:Pr(ùëå|ùëã)‚àïPr(ùëå)  = Pr(ùëã and ùëå)‚àï(Pr(ùëã)√óPr(ùëå)) Lift indicates the effectiveness of the association rule over an independent assumption
> 1 :  the association rule is credible and occurrence of itemset X increases occurrence of itemset Y (Pr(ùëå|ùëã)>Pr(ùëå)) 
= 1 : the association rule is not credible and occurrence of itemset Y is independent of occurrence of itemset X (Pr(ùëå|ùëã)=Pr(ùëå)) 
< 1 : the association rule is also credible but occurrence of itemset X actually prohibit occurrence of itemset Y (Pr(ùëå|ùëã)< Pr(Y))

# Maximum Number of Association Rules: 
Given m unique items in universal set I:
Total number of possible itemsets: 2^ùëö‚àí1
Total number of possible association rules:3^ùëö‚àí2^(ùëö+1)+1

# Apriori Algorithm 
Apriori algorithm constrains the search space for rules by discovering frequent itemsets and only examining rules that are made up of frequent itemsets.

Apriori algorithm proceeds in two stages:
1. It identifies frequent itemsets in the data: an itemset with support greater than or equal to the user-specified minimum support threshold. The algorithm begins by scanning the data and identifying the single-item itemsets (i.e. individual items, or itemsets of length 1) that satisfy this criterion. Any single items that do not satisfy the criterion are not be considered further, because support(A&B) ‚â§ support(A).
2. The second step is to select rules. For each frequent itemset L with length k > 1, the following procedure is applied: Calculate all subsets A of length of the itemset such that all the fields in A are input fields and all the other fields in the itemset (those that are not in A) are output fields. Call the latter subset. (In the first iteration this is just one field, but in later iterations it can be multiple fields.) For each subset A, calculate the evaluation measure (e.g., rule confidence) for the rule. If the evaluation measure is greater than the user-specified threshold, add the rule to the rule table, and, if the length k‚Äô of A is greater than 1, test all possible subsets of A with length (k‚Äô ‚Äì 1).
