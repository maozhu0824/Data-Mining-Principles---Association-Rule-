# DATA = data-set-name (This argument identifies the input data set.Each observation must be uniquely identified by a ID variable.)
# MAXBRANCH = positive integer (It specifies the maximum number of children nodes per a parent node.The procedure will attempt to 
create this number of children unless it is impossible. By default, MAXBRANCH = 2 which is appropriate for CART)
# MAXDEPTH = positive integer (It specifies the maximum depth of the tree to be grown.The default value is: MAXDEPTH = integer 
part of (10 / log2(MAXBRANCH))If MAXBRANCH = 2, then MAXDEPTH = 10)
# MINCATSIZE = positive integer (It specifies the minimum number of observations that a category must have in order to be considered
in the split.By default, MINCATSIZE = 1.)
# MINLEAFSIZE = positive integer (It specifies the minimum number of observations that a child node must have in order for the split
to be considered.By default, MINLEAFSIZE = 1.)
# MAXLEAVES = positive integer (It specifies the maximum number of leaf nodes in the tree to be grown.It cannot be specified together
with MAXDEPTH.No default value)

# INTERVALBINS = positive integer (It specifies the number of bins for pre-binning continuous variables. Default value is 100.)
# NODES = DETAIL|SUMMARY (DETAIL: A table that contains the description of the paths and summary of target variable from the root
node to each node. SUMMARY: A table that contains the summary of target variable of every nodes.)
# PLOTS <(ONLY)> <= plot-request <(options)>> (It specifies the tree diagram. You can specify the following plot-request:
                                                                              ALL – All appropriate plots

# The ID statement specifies the variable whose values will uniquely identify the observations.
# Syntax
ID variable;


# The CLASS statement specifies names of variables which will be treated as categorical variables in the analysis.
# Syntax
CLASS variables </ class-options>;

# The MODEL statement specifies the target variable and the predictors in growing the tree. By default, all variables are treated 
as continuous unless those specified in the CLASS statement.
# Syntax
MODEL response <(response-option)> = variable <variable...>;

# GROW: It specifies the criterion by which to grow the tree.
# Syntax
GROW criterion;  (Criteria: ENTROPY for categorical target variable; RSS for continuous target variable)

# CODE: It specifies the filename to where the DATA step codes are written. The codes can be included in another DATA step to 
produce predicted target values for a dataset.
